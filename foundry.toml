# Possible values are: 'default', 'strip', 'debug' and 'verboseDebug'.
# 'default' does not inject compiler-generated revert strings and keeps user-supplied ones.
# 'strip' removes all revert strings (if possible, i.e. if literals are used) keeping side-effects
# 'debug' injects strings for compiler-generated internal reverts, implemented for ABI encoders V1 and V2 for now.
# 'verboseDebug' even appends further information to user-supplied revert strings (not yet implemented)
